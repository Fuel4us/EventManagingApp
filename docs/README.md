# 1. Individual Pages

These are links for the individual pages/folders of each Student. The first two are only examples. After knowing his/her Student Team Number, each student should update the table and the folder structure of the repository accordingly.

For instance, if my name is Maria Ferreira and I have the Student Team Number 2 I should update the row number 2 in this table. I should also create a new folder in the repository, as illustrated.

|Student Team Number |Student Name                         |Link         											  |

# 2. Sprints

The following table is used to register the work of the students that are selected to present at each Sprint Review. For instance, if I am Student "Maria Ferreira" (1133224) and I was selected to make the second presentation for Sprint 1 then I should update this table as illustrated.

**Documentation for each Sprint**

|Sprint  | Sprint Presentation 1                  |  Sprint Presentation 2                |  Sprint Presentation 3                |  Sprint Presentation 4                |  Sprint Presentation 5                |
