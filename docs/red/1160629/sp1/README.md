# 1. General Notes

*In this section you should register important notes regarding your work during the sprint. For instance, if you spend significant time helping a colleague or if you work in more than one feature increment.*

# 2. Requirements

A functioning Extension framework must be developed, to support extensions that allow to change cell content/style
	
# 3. Analysis




## 3.1 GWT and Project Structure

At this point in the Project, due to GWT restrictions, and as extensions must influence the Client aswell as the Server, instantiation of extensions will be hardcoded, and they will all be defined before runtime.

## 3.3 Server and RPC

## 3.4 Analysis Diagrams

# 4. Design

## 4.4. Design Patterns and Best Practices

Also, creation of a View for Extension configuration was necessary.

# 6. Integration/Demonstration
