**Gon√ßalo Silva** (1161140) - Sprint 1 - Core06.1
=================================================

## Requirements

**Core06.1 - Calendar**

The application should have a calendar view to display events. An event has a title, description, time stamp and duration. Events should be displayed in the calendar ordered by their time stamp. It should be possible to create, edit and delete events. The calendar should display all events.

* US1 - As a User, I want to access my calendar, so I can view my events.

* US2 - As a User, I want to create an event, so I can .

* US3 - As a User, I want to edit a previously created event, so I can correct misspelled information.

* US4 - As a User, I want to delete an event, so I can .

## Design

**Tests**

Regarding tests we try to follow an approach inspired by test driven development. However it is not realistic to apply it for all the application (for instance for the UI part). Therefore we focus on the domain classes and also on the services provided by the server.
