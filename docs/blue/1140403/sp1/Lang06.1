    Lang06.1 - Macros Language

    The application should have a new option to open a window to edit and execute 
a single macro. Macros should be designed as a complete new language in the 
application. However, its initial grammar should be very simple and "inspired" 
in the language of the formulas. In particular, a macro is simply a sequence of 
formulas that are executed sequentially. The formulas are the same as those used 
in the cells. Each line of the macro may contain a formula or be a comment. 
A comment is a line that starts with the character ";". The lines of the macros 
must support all that is possible to do with the cell formulas that start with 
"=" (but in the macros the lines can not start with "="). The macro is to be 
associated with the current workbook. The result of executing a macro is the 
result of the last executed instruction. The new window should have an area to 
edit the text of the macro and button to run the macro. The result of the 
execution of the macro should also appear in the window.
