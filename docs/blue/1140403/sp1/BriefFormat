Lang06.1-Macros Language 

##Observations

- Macros should be designed as a complete new language in the application.

- Its initial grammar should be very simple and "inspired" in the language of the 
formulas.

- A macro is simply a sequence of formulas that are executed sequentially.

- The formulas are the same as those used in the cells

- Each line of the macro may contain a formula or be a comment. A comment is a 
line that starts with the character ";"

- In the macros, the lines can not start with "="

- The macro is to be associated with the current workbook.    //Workbook will have one macro

- The result of executing a macro is the result of the last executed instruction.

-The new window should have an area to edit the text of the macro and button to 
run the macro

-The result of the execution of the macro should appear in the window

##Brief Format

The user starts the process of editing and executing a macro. The system opens the 
macro and displays it. The user edits the macro and executes it. The system shows
the result of the macro. The use case ends
